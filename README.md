# Deep learning methods for Human stress prediction

This repository contains the code and Jupyter notebooks developed for my thesis project. It is organized into the following folders:

- **Baseline_code**: This folder consists of baseline code provided by the MuSe-stress challenge. The main objectives of this code are:
  - Implement a baseline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, considering its capability in handling sequential data.
  - Explore different configurations, such as varying hidden layer dimensions and learning rates, to optimize model performance.
  - Utilize a windowing method to segment input features during training.

- **Classification**: In this folder, you will find similar files as in the Baseline_code folder, but with modifications to the architecture and evaluation criteria to suit the classification task.

- **Multitask_learning**: This folder also contains similar files as the Baseline_code folder, but the code is manipulated to suit and work for multitask learning methods.

- **Thesis_Project_Files**: This folder contains various Jupyter notebooks with thesis-related files such as:
  - `Data_transformation_for_classification.ipynb`
  - `ECG_feature_extraction.ipynb`
  - `FAUS and spectrogram extraction.ipynb`
  - `Multimodal co learning.ipynb`

Each notebook serves a specific purpose related to the data transformation, feature extraction, and multimodal co-learning aspects of the thesis project.
